# chebfunjax: handoff to a Codex agent (2026-10-02)

## Latest shared checkout status (2026-10-06; takes precedence below)

Full MATLAB7574c77 and322-page parity remains incomplete and active. Work in
`/scratch/gpfs/GILLES/mg6942/tmp/chebfunjax_goal_shared_20261005/publication_checkout`.
Read `CURRENT_GOAL_STATUS.md` in its parent for current evidence and next gaps.
The original home checkout and twelve interrupted scripts remain protected;
all writes, environments, receipts and outputs belong under shared scratch.

Ordinary non-force pushes now work in the normal execution context. Licensed
MATLAB R2025b also runs normally on CPU. Earlier SSH/startup restrictions in
historical notes are resolved; do not bypass SSH/configuration/licensing rules.
Use `gh-cli`, explicit staging, GPT-6 commit trailer and full Ruff gates.
CPU only; heavy local examples/tests serial. At most two helpers: cheap routine
work plus Astra medium numerical review as explicitly requested by the user.

P91 parent main checkpoint `c068b83fa363b421c22028c07631663b3a88db09` contains
91 published packages. P87 fixes generated Pixi editable metadata without
external package upgrades; locked installation succeeds. P88 source scheduler
passed145 CPU cases; P90 bounded JAX detector passed162; P91 one-pass bounded
merge and original callback breakpoint values passed178, retaining original
MATLAB numerical bounds. These gates overlap and are not added.

This P92 state-preservation package passed70 CPU tests with no failures,
errors or skips, including unchanged original MATLAB expm/periodicBVP tests.
Zero-time operator propagation preserves initial blocks without resampling;
physical periodic derivatives preserve known real/complex state. Full Ruff,
F821 and diff gates precede publication. Exact-byte receipts and tested trees
are under the shared root, named `ci_state_p92_*`; publication receipt records
the resulting commit, ordinary push, bundle and full archive verification.

CI remains unresolved. Exact prior run logs expose sphere multistep error
3.801e-9 against1e-10 and an extracted-column norm2.298e-16 againsteps2.220e-16.
P92 addresses the separate zero-time length mismatch and periodic derivative
cast failure; no latest green CI or full-suite acceptance is claimed. P91 CI
run37460494400 is executing; its documentation deployment succeeded. Monitor
exact commit SHAs and completed-job REST logs rather than historical green runs.

Fresh cached-text audit covers all322 current pages: ordered prose, equations,
tables and2403 input blocks match. Eleven output-count differences and one
AtmosphericTemperature image-slot gap remain; calculations/stdout/pixels are
excluded. P89 Resampling restricts THEN simplifies per MATLAB curly indexing;
its actual CPU run/page/six600x270 images are published, but13 inverse endpoints
versus freshMAT12 and all six image pixel mismatches remain. Earlier claims that
the old script was source-faithful are withdrawn. Exact twelve-original-script
disposition remains open; see parent `handoff_twelve_exact_disposition_p89_update_20261006.md`.

Next work: source sphere output representation and strict column-evaluation
roundoff; actual seven-assertion public detector/blowup port; singular/unbounded
merge assertions12,13; full function/test/page/figure/RNG/performance parity.
Fresh Fejer-I source weights pass the strict n10 sum; exact-input diagnostic
isolates the JAX inverseFFT stage, with no accepted production repair yet.
Do not truncate columns, normalize weights, widen bounds or target cached counts.
Source drafts, baselines and fresh MATLAB oracles are preserved in shared scratch.

This document takes over from the Claude session that ran the parity
campaign from 2026-07 to 2026-09. `HANDOFF.md` (2026-07) is older and partly
stale: where they disagree, this file wins.

## 1. Mission and standing rules

The goal is full parity with MATLAB Chebfun (commit `7574c77`, source at
`/scratch/gpfs/GILLES/mg6942/chebfun_matlab_ref`). That covers every library
function and every MATLAB test, and every chebfun.org example page must be
replicated exactly: same prose, same computations, the same printed outputs
and the same figures at the same sizes.

Rules the user has set (all still in force):

- **Push directly to `main`; CI is the only reviewer.** Never force-push. Use
  `gh-cli` (not `gh`) for GitHub.
- **Stage with explicit pathspecs.** Never `git add -A` on the whole tree,
  since other agents may share it.
- **Library code is JAX-only.** Any file that imports numpy needs a
  `# uses-numpy: <reason>` comment, which CI checks. Every public function
  needs a `Provenance` docstring section naming the MATLAB source and the
  `Chebfun commit: 7574c77` line.
- **Tolerances.** Never widen a test tolerance without a comment explaining
  why, with the MATLAB value and ours.
- **Lint.** `ruff check src tests scripts examples` must pass before every
  push; CI lints `examples/` too.
- **Commit trailer.** End every commit message with
  `Co-Authored-By: <your model> <noreply@...>`.
- **Storage.** Never write data under `/home/mg6942`. Put scratch in
  `~/myscratch/tmp/<dated-name>/`, or `/scratch/gpfs/GILLES/mg6942/_agent_scratch/`
  for work that spans sessions.
- **Token budget.** Be economical: at most 2 parallel sub-agents, on a cheap
  model or low reasoning effort for routine script fixes.
- **Examples use the library.** They are translations: never re-implement a
  library feature in numpy inside an example. When the library is wrong or
  missing something, fix the library (with tests) or log it in section 6.

## 2. Environment: fix this first

**The pixi environment is gone.** `.pixi` is a symlink to
`/scratch/gpfs/CRYOEM/gilleslab/chebfunjax_pixi_env_20260702/.pixi`, which
has been deleted. Recreate it:

```bash
cd ~/chebfunjax
rm .pixi                                   # dangling symlink
mkdir -p /scratch/gpfs/GILLES/mg6942/_agent_scratch/chebfunjax_pixi_20261002
ln -s /scratch/gpfs/GILLES/mg6942/_agent_scratch/chebfunjax_pixi_20261002 .pixi
pixi install                               # ~/.pixi/bin/pixi
pixi run smoke
```

Always run Python as
`JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 MPLBACKEND=Agg .pixi/envs/default/bin/python ...`.
Without `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`, linear algebra on the login node is about 70x
slower.

MATLAB R2025b is available for reference runs:
`module load matlab/R2025b; matlab -batch "addpath('/scratch/gpfs/GILLES/mg6942/chebfun_matlab_ref'); run('x.m')"`
(about 1 minute of startup).

The MATLAB example sources are at `/scratch/gpfs/GILLES/mg6942/chebfun_examples/<cat>/<Stem>.m`.

## 3. State at handoff

- `main` is at `ecfda8fc`, and CI passed on the last three pushes.
- 322 example pages (`docs/examples/<cat>/<Stem>.md`) are generated from the
  chebfun.org HTML plus our script output.
- A structural audit finds 295 of 322 pages whose printed output blocks line
  up with the original. The 27 that don't are listed in section 5.
- Example figures are saved with
  `chebfunjax.plotting.save_chebfun_figure(fig, path, size=(w, h))`. The
  default is 600x270; other pages use the size of the reference PNG in
  `/scratch/gpfs/CRYOEM/gilleslab/chebfunjax_audit_20260702/refs/docs/images/<cat>/`.
- `TEST_CHECKLIST.md` (generated by `scripts/gen_test_checklist.py`) records
  MATLAB test-suite coverage: 1069 ported, 26 skipped by policy (chebgui,
  adchebfun), 7 missing (chebgui).

### Uncommitted work in the tree: verify or revert

Interrupted agents left edits that have not been verified, in 12 example
scripts and their images:

```
examples/approx/best_approx.py              examples/pde/trapezoideigs.py
examples/approx/fermi_dirac.py              examples/roots/marching_squares.py
examples/approx2/localization.py            examples/sphere/atmospherictemperature.py
examples/fourier/fourier_based_chebfuns.py  examples/sphere/laplaceball.py
examples/linalg/vandermonde_arnoldi.py      examples/stats/resampling_random_variables.py
examples/ode-nonlin/delay_differential_equations.py
examples/ode-random/randomswitching.py
```

Modified images also appear under `docs/images/` for GlobalMinimum and
WhiteCurves, whose scripts are unchanged; those were overwritten by a test
run, so revert them with `git checkout`. For each script, run it alone, run
`unmatched.py` on its page (section 4), then commit or
`git checkout -- <file>`.

Four scripts are slow or failed when run in parallel: VandermondeArnoldi
(over 30 min), DelayDifferentialEquations (over 1 h, because piecewise delay
chebop solves are slow), RandomSwitching (crashed at about 25 min) and
AtmosphericTemperature (killed, probably out of memory, while other jobs
ran). Run them one at a time, or as a CPU Slurm job on a general partition
with about 32G of memory.

## 4. Tooling

The durable copies are in `/scratch/gpfs/GILLES/mg6942/_agent_scratch/chebfunjax_handoff_20261002/`
(called `$D` below):

| Item | What it does |
|---|---|
| `scripts/gen_example_pages.py` (in the repo) | Builds `docs/examples/<cat>/<Stem>.md` from the chebfun.org HTML (prose, headings, MATLAB cells, figure slots), our stdout and our images. `--stdout-dir $D/stdout --html-cache $D/pages_html [cat/Stem ...]`; with no pages it does all of them. It reports missing images and output blocks it couldn't match. |
| `$D/pages_html/<cat>_<Stem>.html` | Cached chebfun.org pages. This is the target for the print format; the pages were published with `format long`. |
| `$D/stdout/<cat>_<script>.txt` | Our latest stdout per script, which feeds the page generator. Regenerate it by running the script with stdout redirected there. |
| `$D/regen_all.py [substr ...]` | Runs example scripts 6 at a time with a 30-min cap, writing stdout and stderr to `$D/stdout/` and rc lines to the log (`REGEN_LOG` env). |
| `$D/run_slow.sh <script>` | Runs one script with a 4-h cap and appends to `slow_runs.log`. |
| `$D/unmatched.py <cat>/<Stem>` | Lists the page's output blocks that our stdout lacks, with the MATLAB input cell that produced each. |
| `$D/structure_audit.py` | Audits every page: blocks whose line counts differ, and extra lines we print. Writes `structure_audit.csv`. |
| `$D/refs_matlab/`, `$D/compare_vs_matlab.py` | MATLAB R2025b reruns of the examples (diary output). Use them only to compare numbers; a fresh rerun defaults to `format short`. |
| `$D/batch_prompt.md` | The prompt template used for the page-fidelity sub-agents. |

The workflow for one page:

1. Read `$D/pages_html/<cat>_<Stem>.html` and the `.m` source.
2. Edit the script so every output cell prints the same labels and layout and
   every `img/<Stem>_NN.png` is saved in order. Note that a MATLAB `hold on`
   cell produces separate before and after images.
3. Run the script, writing stdout to `$D/stdout/`.
4. Run `unmatched.py`, then `gen_example_pages.py <cat>/<Stem>`.
5. Run ruff, then commit the script, its images and its page.

Library display helpers that already match MATLAB: `repr(chebfun)`,
`Chebfun2.disp()`, `Diskfun.disp()`.

## 5. Remaining example work

Pages the audit marks as not matching (as of 2026-09-24). Many are blocked
only by random draws, which MATLAB's `randn` makes impossible to reproduce,
or by the library issues in section 6. Fix what is fixable in the script and
note the rest.

```
approx/EdgeDetection approx/NoisyNonsmooth approx3/Wagon cheb/ChebExplain
complex/ConformalL fourier/FourierBasedChebfuns geom/Ellipses
linalg/ConstrainedLeastSquares linalg/EigsViaDet linalg/FieldOfValues linalg/SOR
linalg/VandermondeArnoldi ode-eig/Drum ode-eig/Eigenstates ode-linear/DawsonIntegral
ode-linear/Krylov ode-nonlin/Blasius ode-nonlin/Carrier
ode-nonlin/DelayDifferentialEquations ode-nonlin/GulfStream ode-nonlin/IVPCapabilities
ode-random/RandomSwitching opt/Catenary quad/HermiteQuad roots/RandomPolys
sphere/AtmosphericTemperature stats/ResamplingRandomVariables
```

Some audit hits are false positives where the output is already correct
(Blasius, Catenary, Carrier apart from its iteration table).

Other known example gaps:

- **Checkmark** misses the local minimum at alpha = 0. Our E_3 piece on
  [0, 0.48] has 5 coefficients where MATLAB's has 12. Using
  `norm(p - f, inf)` instead of `r.err` would probably fix it, at about twice
  the runtime.
- **LaneEmden** now matches MATLAB (radius 3.653753736219 against
  3.653753736220) but takes about 28 minutes, because the nonlinear system
  Newton step uses a finite-difference Jacobian.

## 6. Library issues found by the examples, not yet fixed

These are ordered by value. Each item names the example that exposes it, and
should be fixed in `src/` with a MATLAB-port test.

1. **`Chebfun.inv` is about 800x slower than MATLAB.** It bisects pointwise:
   ComplexArcLength took 2018 s against MATLAB's 2.5 s. Port `@chebfun/inv.m`,
   which uses a roots-based inverse.
2. **`hermpts` uses only Golub-Welsch.** n = 10^4 takes 136 s, and 10^5 would
   need an 80 GB matrix. Port the GLR and asymptotic methods from `hermpts.m`
   (HermiteQuad).
3. **`ratinterp` returns wrong poles for complex f.** `utils/ratapprox.py`
   (`_chebyshev_roots`, about line 957) takes the real part of the
   coefficients. Its `r_fn` also casts x to float (ThreeBodyProblem).
4. **Building a periodic chebfun2 from complex values is wrong:**
   `chebfun2(complex matrix, trig=True)` gives O(1) errors (GinzburgLandau).
5. **MINRES stalls on indefinite operators.** On `-u'' - 100u` it reaches a
   relative residual of 5.8e-4, where MATLAB reaches 1.85e-15, and it
   diverges on the piecewise case (ode-linear/Krylov).
6. **Nonlinear `Chebop` solves.**
   - Newton starts at 16 points and doubles, restarting each time, while
     MATLAB starts at 64 and refines once to 128. As a result, Carrier's
     starting guesses 2 and 3 converge to different solutions.
   - There is no `'iter'` display, so Carrier's iteration table can't be
     printed.
   - `info["normDelta"]` concatenates the Newton histories of every
     refinement level.
7. **Splitting creates spurious breakpoints.** `_split_edge_fd` zooms to about
   1e-15 regardless of `eps`, which leaves clusters of breakpoints 1e-15 apart
   at eigenvalue-max kinks (EdgeDetection, NoisyNonsmooth).
8. **Backslash on an ill-conditioned basis is far less accurate than MATLAB.**
   The quasimatrix `\` gives a vertical scale of 7.7e7 where MATLAB gets 1.5
   (VandermondeArnoldi).
9. **The IVP marcher returns 16 pieces** where MATLAB returns one smooth piece
   (IVPCapabilities).
10. **The AAA conformal map keeps about twice MATLAB's spurious poles**
    (ConformalL).
11. **There are three `randnfun` implementations.** Only
    `chebfun1d/randfuns.py` follows `randnfun.m`. `cj.randnfun`
    (`utils/random.py`) returns a numpy callable and scales `'big'` wrongly.
    Unify them on the faithful one.
12. **`spin2` only returns arrays.** It doesn't accept a multi-time `tspan` or
    return a chebfun2, and `SpinOp2('gl')` uses a deterministic initial
    condition.
13. **Smaller issues:**
    - `Spherefun.max2` returns the antipode for even functions.
    - `plot_ball_slices` shading and depth order are poor.
    - `plotregion` estimates rho differently from `plotregionData`.
    - Chebfun has no `__rpow__` (`complex ** chebfun` fails).
    - `matlab_plot` gives each piece of a complex piecewise chebfun its own
      colour.
    - `roots(..., 'ms')` finds points MATLAB misses (ResultantMethod).
    - Disk Helmholtz at k = 7 has an error of 3.8e-8 from laplacian noise; the
      test is xfail.
    - There is no phase-portrait plot for complex chebfun2.

## 7. Fixed in September 2026 (for context; don't redo)

- **chebfun2 constructor.** It now uses MATLAB's sampleTest (Halton points),
  standardCheck happiness and global simplify. The Greeks vega matches MATLAB
  to 5e-12.
- **Splitting.** The length cap is now 129 points, the global hscale and
  vscale are threaded through, and detectEdge snaps to endpoints.
- **Small 1-D methods.**
  - `angle` uses atan2 with branch-cut breakpoints.
  - New `chebfun1d.fov`.
  - `restrict` snaps to piece endpoints.
  - `flipud` is exact.
  - `min(f, 'local')` finds kinks.
  - Fractional powers use the principal branch.
- **Chebop.**
  - The nonlinear Newton step uses rectangular projection with cached
    boundary rows, which fixes LaneEmden for n >= 2.
  - Systems accept scalar unknowns.
- **Disk and sphere solvers.**
  - Diskfun Helmholtz and Poisson are now MATLAB's ultraspherical port, about
    90x faster.
  - `Spherefun.rotate` uses MATLAB's ZXZ convention.
  - `randnfunsphere` is stable at high degree.
  - Spherefun `coeffs2vals` is vectorized.
- **Plotting.** New `plot_earth`, and `save_chebfun_figure` produces exact
  pixel sizes.
- **Examples.** The `_replica` suffix is gone, about 150 scripts were
  rewritten cell by cell, and every page figure is present.
